  <SPAN style="LINE-HEIGHT: 115%; FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'; FONT-SIZE: 10pt;">My
  daughter found this place for me. I moved in as a respite stay and liked it so much that I
  moved in permanently. I’ve made new friends, and they have become my companions.
  My favorite activity is Bean Bag Toss, and I’ve gotten pretty good at it!</SPAN>
