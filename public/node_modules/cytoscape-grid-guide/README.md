cytoscape-grid-guide
================================================================================

## Description

<img src="guideline-example.png" width="300">

A sophisticated Cytoscape.js extension for grid and guideline interactions. providing the following features:

- **Grid**: Shows a grid in the canvas (with specified size).
- **Discrete dragging**: Nodes are allowed to be located in grid locations only during drag; hence the drag is discrete.
- **Auto resizing nodes**: Nodes are resized to fit perfectly to grid.
- **Snap to grid**: Upon release of the mouse during drag, the node snaps to closest grid location.
- **Alignment guidelines on drag**: As a node is dragged different types of guidelines are drawn to indicate both horizontal and vertical alignment of the dragged node with others. Two nodes are considered aligned when the difference between their x or y coordinates are within the specified tolerance:
 - **Reference guidelines**: When the dragged node aligns horizontally or vertically with the position of the mouse when the node is picked for drag, this guideline is drawn.
 - **Geometric guidelines**: When the dragged node (center or edge) aligns horizontally or vertically with another node (center or edge) within specified range, this guideline is drawn.
 - **Distribution guidelines**: This type of guideline is drawn in one of these two different cases:
    - when the center of the dragged node is in the middle of the closer edges of two other nodes horizontally or vertically (i.e. dragged node is in the middle of two other nodes)
    - when the distance between the dragged node A to node C is exactly twice the distance to node B horizontally or vertically (i.e. node B is in the middle of the dragged node A and another node C)
- **Snap to alignment location**: Note that guidelines are drawn when the node is within a certain 'tolerance' amount to perfect alignment. Upon release of the mouse during drag, the node snaps to shown guideline to form perfect alignment.

The users are allowed to customize various things about the functionality including:
- grid size
- alignment guideline tolerance
- colors and line styles of each type of guidelines
- range of geometric and distribution guidelines (i.e. do not consider nodes that are outside this range for alignment)
- whether or not edge to center alignment should be ignored

## API

 * `cy.gridGuide(options)` Sets stated options any time wanted.
 
 * `eles.align(horizontal, vertical, alignTo)` Aligns vertically/horizontally dimensions of eles to first element of eles
 ( or if alignTo is specified aligns to it). `horizontal` param may get `top`, `center`, `bottom` and `vertical` param may get `left`, `center`, `right` and `horizontal`.
 
 For example the code below aligns selected nodes to top left of first selected node.
```js
cy.nodes(":selected").align("top", "left")
```
 
# Default Undo/Redo Actions
```js
ur.do("align", {
    nodes: cy.nodes(":selected"),
    vertical: "left",
    horizontal: "top",
    alignTo: cy.nodes(":selected")[0],
})
```

## Dependencies

 * Cytoscape.js ^1.6.10
 * jQuery ^1.4 || ^2.0 || ^3.0


## Usage instructions

Download the library:
 * via npm: `npm install cytoscape-grid-guide`,
 * via bower: `bower install cytoscape-grid-guide`, or
 * via direct download in the repository (probably from a tag).

`require()` the library as appropriate for your project:

CommonJS:
```js
var cytoscape = require('cytoscape');
var grid-guide = require('cytoscape-grid-guide');

grid-guide( cytoscape, jquery ); // register extension
```

AMD:
```js
require(['cytoscape', 'cytoscape-grid-guide'], function( cytoscape, grid-guide ){
    grid-guide( cytoscape ); // register extension
});
```

Plain HTML/JS has the extension registered for you automatically, because no `require()` is needed.


## Publishing instructions

This project is set up to automatically be published to npm and bower.  To publish:

1. Set the version number environment variable: `export VERSION=1.2.3`
1. Publish: `gulp publish`
1. If publishing to bower for the first time, you'll need to run `bower register cytoscape-grid-guide https://github.com/iVis-at-Bilkent/cytoscape.js-grid-guide.git`
